# software-design-document


Our client for this project was "The Gaming Room", they were looking to expand one of their Android based games so that it can be played on multiple different operating systems. In developing this documentation, I explained the differences, advantages and disadvantages of each operating system particularly well in regards to the request. I found the process of creating and referring to UML diagrams helpful when developing the code for this project. If I could choose one part of the document to revise it would be the recommendations section. I would improve this section by providing more detail about storage and memory management options, and also clearly state the best direction for the client. I interpreted and implemented the clients needs by carefully going over their requirements and goals. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because ultimately, they need to use the software. In order to keep active users, the software must be effecient, and user-friendly. We used an object-oriented approach to designing this software. I would use some of the same techniquies and strategies to design a similar application in the future, such as implementing a Singleton tester class.
